The `README.md` file explains how to use the single-page HTML portfolio template. It covers four main points:

*What it is:A simple portfolio website built with semantic HTML, featuring sections for About, Projects, Skills, and Contact.
* How to Set Up:To use it, you need to create a folder named `images` for your profile picture and place the `index.html` file in the main project folder.
* How to Customize:You can personalize the website by editing the text, project details, and skills directly within the `index.html` file.
